      <li>4-6 eggs, room temperature</li>
      <li>1 cup rice, washed</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Boil bouillon cubes in a stew pot 3/4 full.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, whisk eggs with a little salt (no more than 1/4 tsp) and flour by the 1/4 cup until you have a thick dumpling batter. (It should drip off the spoon.)</li>
      <li>Drop dough into the boiling water by spoonfuls. Add water as needed.</li>
      <li>Turn the fire low. Add rice. Stir and simmer for another 10 minutes or until rice is fully cooked.</li>

    <h3>Tip!</h3>
    <p>If you want something even more filling, use <strong>egg noodles</strong> instead of rice!</p>
